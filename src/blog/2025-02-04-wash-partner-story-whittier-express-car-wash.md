“EverWash made our transition as new owners seamless,” says Daniel Lee, owner of Whittier Express Car Wash in Whittier, California. “When I took over Whittier Express, I was worried about how many members we might lose and the challenge of re-enrolling existing ones. Thankfully, EverWash was already in place, and re-enrollment was a non-issue. With their help, we easily communicated updates to our customers, putting everyone at ease. The transition team was incredibly helpful, communicative, and cooperative—it truly felt like a team effort."

He adds, “Once we started operating, I realized how much more EverWash could offer. Beyond simplifying operations, their ongoing support, resources, and guidance have been invaluable. If you’re taking over a wash with EverWash already in place, don’t stress—you’ll have much bigger things to worry about if you decide to go without them.”
