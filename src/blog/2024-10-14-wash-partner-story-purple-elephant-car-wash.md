**EverWash Delivers Stability and Growth to Purple Elephant**

For Allan Scozzari, owner of Purple Elephant Car Wash in Middletown and Naugatuck, CT, stability and customer satisfaction are essential to his success. EverWash has been a key partner in delivering both.

“EverWash has helped grow my membership program by 60%, providing a steady income stream from customers who see the value in regular car washes,” says Allan. “The retail car wash business can be unpredictable with factors like weather and competition, but with a strong membership base, my monthly revenue is secure. For Auto Spa, reducing that risk is crucial.”

He adds, “Membership is the way forward. It brings stability to our business—there’s no question about it. With memberships, you don’t even care when it rains!”

**Seamless Customer Service and Business Growth**

“EverWash is the only professionally managed membership solution in the industry,” Allan explains. “They offer 24/7 customer support for members, marketing insights, and campaign support, which frees me to focus on scaling my operations.”

Managing customers can be a full-time job, but with EverWash, Allan can leave that to the experts: “EverWash makes it so easy. Scott Caplan, the CEO, is always available—no matter when I call. That kind of support is invaluable.”
