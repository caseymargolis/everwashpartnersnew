**EverWash Delivers Membership Success at ProClean Auto Wash**

Kim Allen, managing 27 car washes in Colorado, credits EverWash for successfully introducing memberships to in-bay automatics. “EverWash made it easy for us to offer memberships and compete with tunnel washes. The membership program has created consistent, predictable revenue, and the loyalty of our customers is unmatched.”

She adds, “Their customer service is top-notch. They handle the membership logistics, so we can focus on the operations. It’s been a game changer for our business.”
