The EverWash team is built on passion, drive, and a deep understanding of the car wash industry — because many of us started right where our wash partners are today. 

Few embody this journey better than [Nash Goudie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nashgoudie/), our Digital Marketing Manager. His story is a testament to the power of hard work, ambition, and the limitless opportunities in the car wash industry.

*[Car Wash Magazine](https://www.carwashmagazine.com/stories/car-wash-profile-nash-goudie-when-standing-out-comes-naturally)* recently profiled Nash’s career, highlighting his rapid rise from car wash attendant to marketing leader. What started as a part-time job at 16 quickly turned into a full-fledged career, thanks to his natural talent for sales, marketing, and leadership. 

Nash’s journey has taken him from the wash bays of Rocky Mountain Car Wash to becoming an integral part of EverWash’s success, shaping marketing strategies and driving engagement across millions of customers.

In the words of EverWash’s Director of Marketing & Communications, Max Pulcini: 

> “He’s made such a tremendous impact, and we wouldn’t be the company that we are and have some of the capabilities that we do today without him.”

Nash’s story is proof that the car wash industry offers more than just jobs—it offers careers. Read the [full article about Nash’s journey](https://www.carwashmagazine.com/stories/car-wash-profile-nash-goudie-when-standing-out-comes-naturally) in *Car Wash Magazine*.
