**EverWash Fuels Growth for Exclusive Car Wash**

Rico Danesi, owner of Exclusive Car Wash in Danbury, CT, shares how EverWash transformed his business: “EverWash helped us stabilize revenue by growing a membership program that’s not weather-dependent. Starting with zero members, we’ve grown exponentially every year.”

He adds, “EverWash is more than just a membership program; it’s a full solution with app integration, marketing support, and ongoing partnership. The results speak for themselves—it’s been a fantastic experience.”
