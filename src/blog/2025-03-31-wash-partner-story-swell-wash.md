Lauren and Greg Hough are the owners of Swell Car Wash, a growing chain of car washes in South Jersey. As veterans of the petroleum industry, they brought deep business experience to the table — but when they entered the car wash world, they knew they needed a partner to help them do it right. That’s why they turned to EverWash to manage the membership programs at their new locations.

Here’s what Lauren had to say about the partnership, and how professionally managed membership has transformed their business:

“After purchasing our first two washes, we knew a membership model would be a key element to our success based on a mix of customer behavior trends and financial strategy. First and foremost, memberships provide predictable and recurring revenue through steady cash flow, regardless of weather or season. Memberships also increase customer ‘stickiness,’ and will keep customers retained as long as you’re providing a great service. Our experience has shown that the total revenue from a loyal member often surpasses what they’d spend as a casual customer. Lastly, members give you better data (contact info, usage patterns), which you can use for upsells, referrals, and targeted promotions.

Ultimately, partnering with EverWash came down to their ingrained focus on membership and customer engagement. We knew we wanted to launch a membership program, but we also knew it wasn’t just about slapping a subscription on the menu but rather how you market it, sell it, and retain members. EverWash brought us proven tools, technology, and best practices to actually grow a successful membership base, not just manage it.

On top of that, their platform handles a lot of the heavy lifting including billing, customer service, sales coaching, and even data insights. That allowed us to stay focused on running a great car wash while knowing the membership side was being driven by a true partner who specializes in it.

One thing I truly appreciate about EverWash is their willingness to adjust and evolve to help drive our business strategies. Every car wash is a little different, and it was vital that they were flexible and helped tailor things to fit our location and customers. We are thrilled to be an EverWash partner!”
