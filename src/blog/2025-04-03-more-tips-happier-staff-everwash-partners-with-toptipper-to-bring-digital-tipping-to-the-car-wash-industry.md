At EverWash, we’re always working to bring car wash operators powerful tools that drive revenue and improve team performance. That’s why we’re excited to announce our latest partnership with **TopTipper** — the simple, secure, and cashless tipping platform designed for today’s service industry.

This partnership makes it easier than ever for your staff to get tipped — and for your customers to show appreciation. Whether you’re an **EverWash Wash Partner** or an independent operator, **TopTipper is available to you**.

### Why Digital Tipping Matters at Car Washes

Let’s face it: people don’t carry cash like they used to. That means fewer tips for your hardworking staff — and lower morale for the team that keeps your wash running smoothly.

**TopTipper changes that.** With a quick QR code scan or a tap inside the EverWash App, customers can leave a tip using Apple Pay, Google Pay, or a card. No extra apps. No awkward “do you have change?” moments.

### How It Works

* **EverWash Wash Partners:** TopTipper is already built into the EverWash App. Sign up at [toptipper.co/sign-up/](https://toptipper.co/sign-up/?utm_campaign=Everwash&utm_medium=blog2) and then just [contact your Account Manager](mailto:accountmanagement@everwash.com) to turn it on — no tech integration needed.
* **Non-Everwash Operators:** TopTipper is available to any car wash operator. Just visit [TopTipper.co](https://toptipper.co/industry-carwash/?utm_campaign=Everwash&utm_medium=blog1) to get started in minutes.

### Real Results from the Field

Don’t just take our word for it. Three EverWash locations already using TopTipper have seen strong results:

* **KC’s Car Wash** processed 1,094 digital tips totaling $5,114.50, with an average tip of $4.68.
* **EverWash Unlimited** processed 1,780 digital tips totaling $9,069.91, with an average tip of $5.10.
* **Asbury Circle Car Wash** earned $2,129.46 from 345 digital tips — with an impressive average tip of $6.17, all from signage only.

And these numbers are on top of regular cash tips — in fact, TopTipper users often see cash tips increase or remain steady.

“TopTipper has been a great source of additional income for my employees,” said KC Fordham, owner of KC’s Car Wash and long-time EverWash wash partner. “It’s completely additive. My people love it — and I’m expanding it to my other businesses too.”

Operators love the real-time reporting, staff recognition, and optional integration with Google and Yelp reviews. Meanwhile, staff loves the extra income.

### Why This Matters for You

Adding TopTipper to your wash:

* Boosts employee morale and retention
* Increases customer satisfaction and engagement
* Costs you nothing to implement
* Modernizes your wash’s service experience
