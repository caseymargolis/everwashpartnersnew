If there was one theme for car wash operators in 2025, it was stability. Weather swings, unpredictable traffic patterns, rising operating costs, and increased competition pushed more washes to rely on dependable, recurring revenue. Membership continued its evolution from a “nice-to-have” to a core pillar of a modern car wash business.

At EverWash, we spent the year focused on building better tools, better programs, and better partner experiences to help operators keep revenue strong, even when the weather or daily traffic isn’t. As we look back on the year, the milestones that mattered most were the ones that helped washes grow, protect, and modernize their businesses.

### Membership Growth Driven by Real Operator Success

Across the country, more operators turned to EverWash to stabilize revenue and create predictable cash flow—especially during closures caused by deep freezes, heavy rain, and equipment downtime.

Membership continued to deliver:

* Reliable revenue, regardless of weather
* Higher customer loyalty
* More consistent operations
* Stronger long-term business value

For many operators, 2025 wasn’t just about launching a membership program—it was about finally getting the right tools, systems, and support to grow one with confidence.

### EverWash at Industry Trade Shows

2025 was also a major year for connecting with operators face-to-face. EverWash had a strong presence at key industry events, meeting hundreds of wash owners, showcasing new tools, and sharing best practices for maximizing membership revenue.

*SCWA 2025 – Fort Worth, TX*

*The Car Wash Show 2025 – Las Vegas, NV*

*NRCC 2025 – Atlantic City, NJ*

Across all three shows, the takeaway was clear: operators are looking for dependable tools, better data, and a partner who truly understands membership. EverWash was proud to be that partner throughout the year.
