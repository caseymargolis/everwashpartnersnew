The holidays aren’t just the busiest time of year for shopping — they’re also one of the busiest seasons for car washes. Across the country, operators see higher wash volumes in the winter as drivers battle salt, slush, and snow. That makes December the perfect time to promote your membership program, strengthen member loyalty, and drive recurring revenue that lasts through the new year and into pollen season.

With EverWash, operators can launch creative, holiday-themed promotions that get customers excited about membership, boost on-site sales, and turn one-time visitors into loyal subscribers.

Make Memberships the Center of Your Holiday Promotions

Instead of traditional one-off discounts or wash books, use the holidays to highlight the long-term value of your EverWash membership program. Offer new members added perks, like:

* Holiday freebies (air fresheners, microfiber towels, or dashboard wipes)
* Limited-time signup incentives, such as a discounted first month
* Attendant-driven contests, rewarding team members for every membership they sell during the holiday season

These simple, seasonal touches give customers a reason to act now — and help your attendants stay motivated when wash traffic is at its peak.

Pro Tip: Position membership as a practical, feel-good gift to oneself: “Treat your car — and your wallet — this holiday season with unlimited washes.”

## Drive Family Plan Sign-Ups for Multi-Car Households

EverWash’s Family Plan feature is one of the easiest ways to grow your membership base during the holidays. With Family Plans, current members can add additional cars under one account at a discounted rate — ideal for couples, parents, or families with multiple vehicles.

Promote your Family Plan as a “holiday bundle” or “family savings special.” Members can keep every car in the driveway clean and protected from road salt and grime, all while saving money compared to individual plans.

Here’s how operators are finding success:

* Run a “Bundle & Save” Campaign: Offer a discount on every added car before December 31.
* Encourage Referrals: Motivate existing members to invite family members to join their plan.
* Highlight the Value: Multiple cars, one bill, one easy app — it’s convenience that sells itself.

Not only does this increase total memberships, but it also boosts retention — families that wash together, stay together.

Engage Members Digitally with EverWash Marketing Tools

EverWash helps you reach your audience across multiple channels — automatically. Our platform supports digital engagement through in-app messages, push notifications, emails, and SMS, making it easy to promote seasonal offers and incentives.

This December, EverWash will promote digital gift cards, Family Plan discounts, and friend invite opportunities within the app and through targeted marketing campaigns — helping participating washes stay front-of-mind during the busy season.

Operators can also coordinate their own campaigns through EverWash’s Partner Marketing Team, who can help with:

* Email and SMS reminders about your holiday offers
* Custom signage for onsite promotion
* Real-time tracking in the EverWash Partner Portal to measure results

## Why the Holidays Matter for Membership Growth

Winter months drive more car wash demand than almost any other season. Customers visit more frequently to protect their vehicles from salt and road grime, and many want a simple, affordable way to maintain that clean-car feeling.

By promoting membership now, operators can capture seasonal demand and turn it into long-term loyalty. Once customers experience the convenience of unlimited washing through the winter, they’re more likely to keep their membership active into spring — when pollen season arrives and wash frequency spikes again.

## The EverWash Advantage

EverWash isn’t just a membership platform — it’s a growth engine for your wash. With tools to promote, track, and manage every aspect of your program, EverWash helps operators turn seasonal opportunities into year-round success.

Our partners benefit from:

* Increased on-site sales through membership promotions
* Seamless Family Plan management
* Built-in marketing support for holiday campaigns
* Automated billing, analytics, and member communication tools

Make the most of this busy season.
