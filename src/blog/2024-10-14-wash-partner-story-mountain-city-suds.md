**EverWash Brings New Life to Mountain City Suds**

Allen Yates, owner of Mountain City Suds in Mountain City, TN, revitalized his car wash with EverWash’s membership program. “The community is going crazy for EverWash. Even in winter, we see around 200 cars daily. People are coming from miles away just for the membership.”

He adds, “Customer service is the most important thing, and EverWash has helped us provide that. Their support has been a game changer for our business.”
