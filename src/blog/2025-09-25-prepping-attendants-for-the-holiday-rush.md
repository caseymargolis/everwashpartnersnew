The holiday season brings more traffic, more transactions, and more opportunities. But without the right preparation, that extra footfall can lead to missed sales and stressed-out staff. Attendants play a critical role in shaping the customer experience and capturing membership conversions during this busy time.

### Training for Sales Success

Give your attendants the tools they need to succeed:

* **Sales Training:** Role-play conversations to help attendants pitch memberships confidently.
* **Product Knowledge:** Ensure attendants fully understand your membership tiers and benefits.
* **Promotional Awareness:** Train staff on seasonal deals so they can promote them without hesitation.

### Motivating Your Team

The holidays are hectic, but motivation keeps spirits high and performance strong. EverWash helps operators engage attendants through:

* Cash incentives that reward attendants for membership sales.
* Communication Tools to keep staff updated on daily goals and promotions.
* Recognition Programs that highlight top performers.

### Streamlining the Process

Attendants shouldn’t have to fight with clunky systems. With the EverWash Attendant App, they can:

* Sign up new members in seconds.
* Apply promotions without hassle.
* Track progress toward personal or team sales goals.

### Customer Experience is Key

A cheerful, informed attendant doesn’t just sell more memberships—they create loyal customers who return. Remind staff that their role is more than transactional; they’re building relationships that last long after the holidays.
