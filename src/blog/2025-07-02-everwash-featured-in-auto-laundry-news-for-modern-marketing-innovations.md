EverWash leadership was recently featured in Auto Laundry News, one of the car wash industry’s most trusted publications. The article, titled [“Modern Marketing Innovations Transforming the Car Wash Experience”,](https://carwashmag.com/modern-marketing-innovations-transforming-the-car-wash-experience/) was authored by our own Max Pulcini, VP of Marketing at EverWash.

In the piece, Max dives into how car wash operators can modernize their marketing to drive real, measurable growth — without needing to be full-time marketers themselves. It’s a practical, forward-thinking guide for owners and operators looking to keep pace with customer expectations and industry trends.

Key takeaways from the article include:

* **The importance of personalization:** Customers expect more than just clean cars; they want relevant offers, loyalty rewards, and communication that feels tailored to them.
* **The power of digital:** From mobile apps and geotargeted promotions to automation and customer data insights, digital tools are reshaping how operators attract and retain members.
* **Why marketing support matters:** Not every car wash has a marketing department, and that’s where a partner like EverWash steps in with ready-to-deploy campaigns, signage, sales training, and more.

The article reinforces a core belief we hold at EverWash: that great marketing doesn’t have to be complicated — but it does have to be consistent, strategic, and aligned with your goals.

We’re proud to be recognized in Auto Laundry News and even prouder to help hundreds of car wash partners grow their businesses through smarter membership marketing.
