Founded in Philadelphia in 1970 by brothers-in-law John Terrizzi and Vincent Pinto, Pit Stop Car Wash began operations as an exterior-only car wash and gas station. 

Years after its founding, Terrizzi, who had previously run an auto-repair shop in South Philadelphia, passed the business on to his son, John Jr. Wanting his son to build his own legacy at the wash, he made John Jr. promise that he would work to expand the business. He made good on that promise.  John Jr. has since handed the reins over to his own son Tim, who is committed to maintaining the integrity of the family business.

“I was born into the business, and I’ve always looked up to my dad and my grandfather,” said Tim. “I’ve really marveled at their work ethic and their ability to reach people, and to mold the lives of the people that came through the place, and to provide people opportunity and respect that they maybe hadn’t received in other places. I always wanted to be like that.”

Pit Stop Car Wash partnered with [EverWash](https://everwash.com/#membership-plans/43) in July 2017. At the time, it was one of only thirty-eight washes on the platform and they currently have more than 800 members. 

Tim is an ambitious, intelligent, and innovative car wash owner. He works diligently with the EverWash team to integrate the EverWash program into a larger and successful professional framework. 

“It’s a great comfort to me that I can reach any of the executives whenever I’d like to, honestly,” Tim said. “If I’ve struggled, I could reach out to anyone for advice, resources, whatever, and there’s a dialogue…I appreciate that aspect of EverWash probably above anything else.”
