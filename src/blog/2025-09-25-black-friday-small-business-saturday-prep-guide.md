For many retailers, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday are the busiest shopping days of the year. But these consumer habits aren’t limited to department stores — car washes can capitalize on the holiday spending rush, too.

Shoppers are already primed for deals and offers during this period. By running well-planned promotions, you can position your wash as part of the holiday excitement and convert casual customers into long-term members.

### Crafting the Right Offers

When planning your promotions, focus on offers that drive long-term value rather than one-time sales:

* **Membership Discounts:** Offer a discounted first month to encourage sign-ups. Once customers experience the convenience of unlimited washes, they’re more likely to stick around.
* **Additional Vehicle Specials**: Holiday season often means family travel. Promote discounts for adding a second or third vehicle to a membership.

### Marketing Your Promotions

The key to holiday promotions is making sure customers know about them. EverWash gives operators a marketing advantage by:

* Sending Automated Holiday Emails to members and expired customers.
* Promoting Offers Through the App with push notifications and in-app messages.
* Providing Custom Signage that highlights promotions on-site, driving impulse sign-ups.

### Engaging Your Staff

Attendants are your front line during the holiday season. Make sure they’re equipped with:

* Clear Scripts for explaining promotions.
* Incentives to encourage sales performance.
* Tools Like the EverWash Attendant App, which makes selling memberships fast and easy.

### Get Ahead, Stay Ahead

Don’t wait until Thanksgiving week to plan your strategy. Prep your staff, lock in your offers, and line up your marketing assets in advance. With EverWash’s support, your wash can turn Black Friday and Small Business Saturday into membership growth drivers.
