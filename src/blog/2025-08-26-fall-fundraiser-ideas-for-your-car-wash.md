Fall is one of the best times of year to bring your community together—and bring in new members—through creative car wash fundraisers. Whether you’re teaming up with a local school, supporting a youth sports team, or giving back to a local nonprofit, fundraising events can attract new customers, drive local buzz, and increase membership sales in a fun, meaningful way.

Here are five fall fundraising ideas car wash operators can put into action this season.

### Partner with Local Schools for Spirit Week

Schools often host spirit weeks and homecoming events during the fall, making it a great time to align your car wash with the action. Offer a portion of the proceeds from a weekend fundraiser to the local PTA, marching band, or sports team. Use signage, social media, and EverWash communications to promote the event, and invite students to help towel-dry cars for tips.

**Bonus tip: Add an incentive for new members—such as donating an extra $5 to the fundraiser for every person who signs up for a membership that day.**

### Host a “Pumpkin Wash” Weekend

Create a festive environment with hay bales, pumpkins, and Halloween-themed décor. Offer free pumpkins with every wash package or membership signup, and promote it as a family-friendly fall event. Invite a local food truck or cider stand to make it a full seasonal experience.

This type of event works great for drawing families into the EverWash ecosystem and encouraging bundled family plans.

### Community Hero Fundraiser (Police, Fire, EMS, Teachers)

Pick a weekend to honor local first responders or educators and donate a portion of proceeds to a cause of their choosing. Offer free washes to those who present valid ID and ask your EverWash account team for help crafting a referral or signup campaign to accompany the event.

This can boost local goodwill while also increasing new customer exposure and trial memberships.

### Thanksgiving “Giveback” Campaign

Leading up to Thanksgiving, invite customers to drop off non-perishable food items at your wash for donation to a local food pantry. Offer discounted upgrades or a free wash to those who participate. For every new member who joins that week, donate a turkey or grocery gift card to a family in need.

This is a great way to blend purpose with performance and show your wash’s community values.

### Don’t Forget to Promote!

Use the EverWash App, signage, in-app messaging, email marketing, and social media to make your fundraiser a success. Need help crafting your campaign? Your EverWash marketing team is here to assist with templates, design support, and strategy.
