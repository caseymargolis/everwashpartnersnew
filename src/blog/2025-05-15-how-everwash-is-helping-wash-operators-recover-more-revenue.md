Membership success isn’t just about signing up new customers — it’s about keeping them. And a surprising amount of revenue can slip through the cracks when payments fail due to expired cards, fraud flags, or billing mismatches.

That’s why [EverWash](https://everwashpartners.com/) has implemented a series of payment optimizations — all aimed at helping wash operators recover more revenue and reduce involuntary churn.

### High Authorization Rates = More Reliable Revenue

Over the last 12 months, EverWash-authorized transactions were approved 97.24% of the time — significantly higher than industry benchmarks. This ensures that more of your members are successfully charged, and fewer are lost due to unnecessary declines.

We’re taking that a step further by now passing ZIP code data with every authorization request. This helps prevent false declines in areas where issuers require address verification — protecting your revenue before it’s ever at risk.

### Smarter Recovery When Payments Fail

Even with strong authorization rates, failed payments can still happen. But we’re recovering more of them than ever. In fact, 64% of failed payments are recovered.

We’re increasing our smart retry attempts from 4 retries in 2 weeks to 8 retries in 1 month, guided by machine learning. This change alone is projected to recover $87,000 in additional revenue across the [EverWash](https://everwashpartners.com/) platform

These changes reduce passive cancellations and help more members stay on board — without needing manual outreach from your team.

### What This Means for Car Wash Operators

As a wash partner, you benefit directly:

* **More successful charges = more predictable revenue**
* **Fewer billing-related cancellations**
* **Less time spent resolving payment issues with members**

And the best part? It all happens automatically.

You don’t need to enable anything or adjust your systems. [EverWash](https://everwashpartners.com/) is handling these improvements on your behalf — because when you win, we all win.
