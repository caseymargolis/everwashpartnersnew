**EverWash Helps Sudz Car Wash Thrive**

Craig Gilham, owner of Sudz Car Wash in Gonzales, TX, has found great success with EverWash’s membership program. “EverWash helped me grow my memberships by 60% in just 12 months. Their support with marketing, technology integration, and member management has been invaluable.”

Gilham highlights EverWash’s commitment: “Their team goes above and beyond to ensure our success. It’s a true partnership that’s helped us engage customers and consistently operate at peak capacity.”

Sudz Car Wash now boasts around 1000 members, and Craig has added more In-Bays to his wash to handle the increased traffic and demand for car wash memberships in his community.
