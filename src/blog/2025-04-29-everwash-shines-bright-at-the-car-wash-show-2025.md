Another Car Wash Show is in the books — and EverWash made the most of it in Las Vegas! This year, we were proud to showcase the tools, technology, and support that help our wash partners Excel at Membership. 

Our booth was buzzing with energy as we walked attendees through the full power of the EverWash membership platform, from our intuitive All-in-One Member App to our newly revamped EverWash Portal — offering real-time insights, attendant performance data, and smarter ways to grow revenue. We also previewed exciting upcoming features, including our upcoming Fleet Management solution and TopTipper, our digital tipping and engagement tool.

In addition to our platform walkthroughs, we shared testimonial videos from real wash partners who have grown their businesses with EverWash, and highlighted our signature services like:

* Automated Marketing Support that drives membership growth
* Attendant Sales Training to boost conversion and engagement
* 24/7 Member Support Call Center that helps reduce churn and improve customer experience

Our very own Max Pulcini took the stage as a featured panelist during [“Captivate. Differentiate. Generate. Illuminate Your Brand with Colored Lighting,”](https://everwashpartners.com/blog/2025-05-05-watch-now-leveraging-lighting-to-grow-your-car-wash-business-and-membership/) a lively discussion on how lighting transforms in-bay and self-serve sites into powerful revenue generators. Max joined Gary Baright (Baright Enterprises), Justin Brossman (G&G Lighting), and Scott Soisson (Sheetz) to share strategies for using lighting to drive traffic, create memorable experiences, and build brand excitement.

Overall, it was incredible to reconnect with so many of our wash partners, and to meet countless new faces — from seasoned operators looking for membership growth strategies to first-time show attendees eager to get started.
