Back-to-school season isn’t just about pencils and parking passes—it’s a golden opportunity to drive membership growth at your wash by targeting both students and the families behind the wheel. Whether your car wash is near a local high school or on the edge of a bustling college town, there are creative, effective ways to connect with younger drivers and their parents.

Here’s how to make the grade this fall with smart, student-focused membership marketing.

## **For College Town Washes: Attracting the Student Market**

College students may not think of a car wash membership as essential—but when marketed the right way, it becomes a time-saver, budget helper, and status symbol. Here’s how to reach them:

### **Offer Student Discounts With ID or .edu Email**

Run a student-exclusive membership deal at the start of the semester. Use signage, flyers at local businesses, and in-app promotions to advertise something like:

**“Show your student ID and get your first month for $5.”**

Tie it into orientation, homecoming, or tailgate season for added relevance.

### **Leverage Local Influencers**

Find local student influencers—RA’s, student athletes, campus clubs—and offer them a free membership in exchange for a shoutout on social media or a referral campaign. College word-of-mouth moves fast.

### **Promote Convenience and Curb Appeal**

Busy students don’t want to wait in line. Promote the speed and convenience of your wash, and frame a clean car as part of their back-to-school confidence:

**“First impressions matter—especially at job fairs, parties, and move-in day.”**

EverWash makes it easy for students to manage everything from their phone—no need to track paper receipts or pay every visit.

## **For High School Families: Sell the Add-On**

Students may not be the ones paying, but they’re definitely the ones driving—and getting their cars dirty. If your wash is in a suburban or residential area, target **parents** with family-focused campaigns that highlight how easy and affordable it is to add their kids to their membership.

### **Highlight Safety & Responsibility**

Parents like the idea of their teens taking care of their vehicle. A car wash membership helps instill responsibility without giving them money for each visit. Use phrases like:

**“Give your teen the tools to care for their ride—and keep your driveway cleaner too.”**

### **Automate the Upsell in the App**

If you’re an EverWash partner, we can help you promote family plans right in the app. From push notifications to emails, we can highlight how simple it is to add a vehicle with just a few taps.

## **Back-to-School Marketing Channels That Work**

Whether you’re targeting parents or students, here are a few proven ways to get the word out:

* **Digital ads**
* **Rack cards** handed out at local events
* **Social media contests** (e.g., “Cleanest Ride on Campus”)
* **Local newsletter shoutouts or flyers at pizza shops, gas stations, and campus bars**

And don’t forget to let your **attendants** know about the promotion. Equip them with talking points for parents and students alike.
