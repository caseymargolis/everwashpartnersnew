The holiday season is here, and it’s the perfect time to help EverWash members share the joy of clean cars with their loved ones! We’ve [created a quick video](https://youtu.be/nkcW0cGaqTs) to show members how they can use the EverWash app to send car wash credit to friends and family.

As an owner, operator, manager or attendant, you might get questions like: **“How can I buy a membership gift card for someone?”**

This video will help you understand the process so you can guide members with ease:

We recommend taking a few minutes to watch the video and familiarize yourself with this feature. It’s a great way to spread holiday cheer and make our members’ lives easier!

Happy Holidays, and thank you for all you do!
