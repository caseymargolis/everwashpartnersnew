Today’s consumers increasingly favor businesses that give back to their communities. By creating a charity partnership, car wash operators can strengthen their reputation, build goodwill, and create new opportunities to grow memberships.

### Choosing the Right Charity

Select a cause that resonates with your community and aligns with your values. Options include:

* Local schools and sports teams.
* Food banks or shelters.
* Environmental or clean water organizations.

The goal is to connect with a cause that your customers are passionate about supporting.

### Structuring the Partnership

There are many ways to support a charity:

* Donation per Wash or Membership: Pledge a set amount for every wash or membership sold during a campaign.
* Special Charity Days: Dedicate one day’s revenue to the cause.
* Long-Term Partnerships: Build ongoing relationships with nonprofits for sustained impact.

### Promoting the Partnership

This is where EverWash gives operators an advantage:

* Custom Signage communicates your partnership on-site.
* Automated Emails and Push Notifications spread the word to members.
* Social Media Templates help share updates with the broader community.

### Impact Beyond Revenue

Charity partnerships don’t just raise money—they raise your profile. Customers see your wash as a community hub and a business that cares, which builds loyalty and boosts membership retention.
