Starting or upgrading a membership program is exciting — but it also comes with a lot of moving parts. Without the right support, that launch energy can quickly turn into launch anxiety.

At EverWash, we believe no operator should feel like they’re figuring it out alone. That’s why we created the Remote Start Team — a dedicated group of technical specialists who make sure your wash launches smoothly, stays connected, and keeps growing with confidence.

Here’s how we help you Excel at Membership from Day One — and every day after.

### What the Remote Start Team Does

Launching a successful membership program isn’t just about setting up an app — it’s about ensuring your entire site is ready to deliver a seamless experience to every customer.

Our Remote Start Team specializes in:

* **Onboarding new wash locations quickly and efficiently**
* **Integrating with existing site equipment, like kiosks, pay stations, and WiFi systems**
* **Troubleshooting network functionality for members and operators**

### What to Expect When You Launch with EverWash

Here’s how the Remote Start Team guides you through a typical launch:

#### 1. Pre-Launch Technical Survey

We review your current setup, hardware, network, and site conditions to flag any issues early — saving time and headaches later.

#### 2. Equipment and Integration Check

We work with you and your local techs to ensure everything is compatible and optimized for membership operations.

#### 3. Site Setup

We help you configure your equipment's settings and connect your wash bay to EverWash tools.

#### 4. Live Launch-Day Support

On launch day, our team is on call to monitor activations & troubleshoot any glitches

#### 5. Post-Launch Follow-Up

After launch, we continue to monitor system performance, assist with any adjustments, and provide tech support as needed.

### Why Ongoing Support Matters

Even after a successful launch, things can change:

* **New equipment installations**
* **Network upgrades**
* **App updates or feature additions**

The Remote Start Team doesn’t disappear after launch — we stay available to:

* **Help reconnect systems if anything changes**
* **Troubleshoot new or evolving issues**
* **Push updates and enhancements**
* **Make sure your tech never becomes a barrier to growth**

### Real People, Real Time, Real Results

Our Remote Start Team isn't a faceless ticket queue. You get real experts who understand:

* **The unique challenges of car wash environments**
* **The intricacies of membership workflows**
* **How to move fast to minimize downtime and maximize member satisfaction**

Partner feedback has been clear: sites that work closely with our Remote Start Team launch faster, sell more memberships, and have fewer tech disruptions over time.
