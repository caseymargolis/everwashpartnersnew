### The Evolution of Carwash Memberships

Over the past decade, car wash memberships have become a game-changer in the industry, and EverWash has been at the forefront of this movement. During the episode, Pulcini and Caplan explored how technology and shifting consumer habits have shaped membership success. They highlighted that today’s customers expect convenience, value, and seamless experiences — factors EverWash prioritizes through both its mobile app and marketing strategies.

### Marketing Strategies That Resonate

Pulcini offered valuable advice on effective marketing techniques for carwash operators, emphasizing the importance of meeting customers where they are — on digital platforms. From targeted social media campaigns to personalized offers, EverWash empowers operators to attract and retain members by delivering relevant, data-driven messaging.

### Strategic Growth Through the Coinless Acquisition

One of the highlights of the podcast was the discussion around EverWash’s acquisition of Coinless. Caplan explained that Coinless, a mobile payment and loyalty solution for self-serve and In-Bay Automatic (IBA) car washes, aligns perfectly with EverWash’s mission to expand membership opportunities across all wash formats. The acquisition strengthens EverWash’s market position, allowing Coinless customers to benefit from enhanced capabilities while unlocking new growth for IBA and self-serve locations.

### What’s Next for EverWash?

Looking ahead, both Pulcini and Caplan hinted at exciting new developments for EverWash. With plans to introduce even more robust features and services, EverWash aims to push the boundaries of what’s possible for carwash operators. These innovations will continue to enhance customer experiences and drive long-term revenue for partner locations.
