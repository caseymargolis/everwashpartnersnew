Safety is non-negotiable in the car wash business. With high-powered machinery, slippery surfaces, and busy traffic flow, even one oversight can lead to injuries or costly liability. Whether you operate a tunnel, IBA, or self-serve location, a proactive approach to safety protects your people—and your business.

### **Top Risks to Watch:**

* Wet floors leading to slips and falls
* Improper machinery use or maintenance
* Vehicle collisions in entry/exit areas
* Chemical exposure during wash cycles or cleanups

### **Best Practices for Daily Safety:**

**Train and Retrain Staff Regularly**

Safety starts with education. Make safety training part of your onboarding—and conduct refreshers often.

**Post Clear Signage**

Ensure all warnings and operational instructions are visible and easy to understand. Include signs for safety gear, equipment procedures, and emergency exits.

**Create a Pre-Shift Checklist**

Review safety procedures before every shift, including equipment checks, PPE availability, and spill kit readiness.

**Keep Chemical Areas Locked and Labeled**

Only trained personnel should handle wash chemicals. Use proper containers and clear labels to prevent accidents.

**Establish Customer Safety Zones**

Make it clear where customers should (and shouldn’t) be, and use traffic guides or cones to avoid confusion at entry and exit points.

### **Going Beyond the Basics:**

Advanced operators are integrating safety into their culture—rewarding safe behaviors, tracking near-misses, and using data to refine processes. At EverWash, we believe that safety is just as important as sales.
