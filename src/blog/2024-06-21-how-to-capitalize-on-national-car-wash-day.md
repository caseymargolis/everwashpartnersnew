National Car Wash Day is a fantastic opportunity for car wash operators to boost their business, attract new customers, and increase community engagement. Celebrated twice a year, on March 28 and July 14, this day brings car owners out to celebrate their vehicles. 

### What is National Car Wash Day?

Interestingly, National Car Wash Day is observed on two different dates. March 28 marks one celebration where various car washes. According to [What National Day Is It](https://whatnationaldayisit.com/day/Car-Wash/), National Car Wash Day popped onto the scene in 2015. 

Meanwhile, July 14 is also recognized as National Car Wash Day, thanks to the efforts of [Bentley Brandon](https://www.instagram.com/bentley_brandon/?hl=en), owner and operator of Luxury Wash, who used his own birthday as the celebratory date. 

According to [Professional Carwashing & Detailing Magazine](https://www.carwash.com/market-focus-car-wash-day-set-july-14th/), Brandon succeeded in getting the first annual Car Wash Day recognized in 2018 in Georgia. The following year, he managed to get the date officially [recognized](https://www.carwash.com/market-focus-car-wash-day-set-july-14th/) in the following nine states:

* *Colorado* 
* *Florida*
* *Georgia*
* *Michigan*
