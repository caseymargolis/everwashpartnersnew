Cold weather will be here before you know it—and that means it’s time for car wash operators to prep their equipment, facilities, and operations for freezing temperatures. A few proactive steps now can help prevent costly breakdowns, icy shutdowns, and dissatisfied members later.

Whether you’re running an IBA, tunnel, or self-serve wash, here’s a checklist of winterization best practices to protect your investment and keep your members happy all season long.

### Insulate All Exposed Plumbing and Pipes

Frozen pipes are one of the most common—and costly—issues car washes face in winter. Inspect your site and wrap all exposed plumbing in proper insulation. Pay special attention to back rooms, outdoor bays, and areas where heated air might not circulate as well.

**Bonus tip: Heat tape can offer extra protection for vulnerable areas like vacuum islands and self-serve bays.**

### Calibrate Your Floor Heat System

If your wash is equipped with floor heat, now’s the time to make sure it’s fully operational. Test the system to confirm it activates at the correct temperature, and inspect sensors, boilers, and control valves for efficiency.

If you don’t have floor heat but operate in a freeze-prone area, it may be time to explore options—especially as member expectations for uptime rise year-round.

### Check and Replace Wiper Blades on Equipment

From dryers to wraparounds, equipment blades take a beating in icy conditions. Cold rubber hardens, which increases wear and tear on your machinery and vehicles. Inspect and replace all blades as part of your winter prep to avoid scratch complaints and costly downtime.

### Clean Out and Drain Unused Systems

Seasonal wash features like bug removal stations or exterior vacuums may not be used in the colder months. Shut these down properly by draining water lines, blowing out residual moisture with compressed air, and disabling any automatic triggers.

Leaving these systems full could lead to burst pipes—or worse, customer injuries from slick surfaces or malfunctioning nozzles.

### Train Your Team to Spot Cold-Weather Red Flags

Operators and attendants should know what to look for during cold snaps: frost on doors, low water pressure, frozen bay floors, or slower equipment response times. Create a winter-specific checklist for daily open and close procedures, and empower your team to escalate concerns early.

EverWash’s support team can also assist with performance coaching, operational audits, and remote monitoring ideas that keep things running smoothly even during weather spikes.
